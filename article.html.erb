        <h2>Our guiding principles of the product development</h2>
        <p>To our knowledge there is no company in the world, except Scrive, that achieves the same level of legal quality of the final document. In fact, most e‐signing services produce signed documents that aren´t provable at all. Unless you want to  trust in the long‐term integrity of their database and their good will to give you access to the data whenever you will need it. We don't believe in trusting the unpredictable and we believe every company should have ownership of their own fate.</p>
        <p>To design our core product to be in tune with these beliefs we used the following guiding principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="bold">Redundant</p>
            <p>The document should not lack evidence We don't want a customer to ever experience lack of evidence to prove the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="bold">Durable</p>
            <p>The document validity should be independent of time. We don't want a customer to ever experience that provability was compromised due to built in time constraints on evidence durability.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="bold">Independent</p>
